import random # importing the random module to use its functions

# A
sum = random.randint(2,12) # generating a random number between 2 and 12
print(sum) # printing the sum

# B
num1 = random.randint(1, 6)  # generating a random number between 1 and 6
num2 = random.randint(1, 6)  # generating a random number between 1 and 6

sum2 = num1 + num2 # adding the two generated numbers
print(sum2) # printing the sum

# The two scenarios are different but result in the same values since the first scenario is generating a random number between 2 and 12 to simulate the sum of the rolls of the two dice. However, the second scenario uses a longer way to simulate the rolls of two dice by generating two numbers between 1 and 6 then adding them.
